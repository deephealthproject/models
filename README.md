# DeepHealth Model Zoo

[Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)](http://onnx.ai) is an open standard format for representing machine learning models. [Read more](https://github.com/onnx/onnx)

The DeepHealth Model Zoo is a collection of pre-trained models in the ONNX format, that we have check that they are compatible with the lastest version of the [EDDL library](https://github.com/deephealthproject/eddl).

We have standardized on [Git LFS (Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to store ONNX model files. To download an ONNX model, navigate to the appropriate Github page and click the `Download` button on the top right.
